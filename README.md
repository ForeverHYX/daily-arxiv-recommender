# Daily arXiv Recommender

Configurable daily arXiv recommender with GitHub Pages publishing, email digests, and feedback hooks.

The target deployment model is serverless:

- GitHub Actions runs the daily pipeline.
- GitHub Pages hosts the static reading interface.
- Supabase stores feedback events.
- Email delivery is handled from GitHub Actions through SMTP.

The current repository starts with a self-contained MVP while upstream `daily-arXiv-ai-enhanced` integration is pending network availability.

## Interest Profile

The active keyword/category profile lives in:

`config/interests.json`

Edit that file to change the recommender's domain without touching Python code. The initial profile is seeded for agentic computer architecture, full-stack hardware/software co-design, CPU/GPU microarchitecture, simulators, and HPC cross-over work.

The profile controls:

- arXiv core categories
- arXiv expansion categories
- recommendation sections and display labels
- weighted keywords
- negative/noise rules
- recovery terms for ambiguous topics

## Development

Run tests:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Build recommendations from JSONL:

```bash
python3 -m paper_recommender.pipeline \
  --input examples/sample_papers.jsonl \
  --profile config/interests.json \
  --feedback examples/sample_feedback.json \
  --output site/recommendations.json
```

## Feedback Storage

Run [supabase/schema.sql](supabase/schema.sql) in your Supabase SQL editor, then configure:

- GitHub Variables: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- GitHub Secrets: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

The public Pages app uses the anon key only to insert feedback. GitHub Actions uses the service role key to read feedback and adjust section weights.
